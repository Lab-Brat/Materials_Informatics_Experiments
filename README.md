# Materials_Informatics_Experiments
This repository contains my Materials Informatics codes that I write for school and for fun.\
decision_tree:
* Si-Ge_MCTree: Application of Monte Carlo Search Tree to the problem of finding optimal structure for thermal conductivity (both highest and lowest thermal conductivity, depending on the problem) in the system of Si and Ge atoms.
* decision_tree.ipynb: Practice code, making decision tree from Iris Dataset.
* monte_carlo_tree.ipynb: Practice code, making decision tree from Iris Dataset with bagging ensemble method.
* weather_ID3.ipynb: Homework, apply ID3 decision tree from scrath in solving a problem of weather prediction.

linear_regression: 
* ex1_fatigue_prediction: Homework, predicting materials fatigue with Linear Regression models (medium dataset). 
* ex2_thermal_conductivity_prediction: Homework, predicting thermal conductivity with Linear Regression models (large dataset). 
* Linear_Regression_Scikit.ipynb: Practice code, applying Simple Linear, Lasso, Ridge Regressions and ElasticNet to predict mechanical properties of materials. 
* diabetes.ipynb: Practice code, applying different Linear Regression models on a diabetes dataset.
* finding_alphas.ipynb: Helper code, a way to find suitable alphas for Lasso and Ridge regressions (does not work well).
